yali-voice.exe is a zip file that must be
compatible with unzip on non-Windows platforms
as well as being self-extracting.

unzipsfx.exe is a Win32 build of unzipsfx
(cross-compiled with Mingw32) with
CHEAP_SFX_AUTORUN defined, and hacked process.c
so it doesn't confirm the Auto-run command.

Use 'make' to makke a new yali-voice.exe from the WAVs.
