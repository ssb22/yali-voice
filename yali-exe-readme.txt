These syllables were recorded in context by
Cheng Ya Li for the Gradint program in June
2008.  Sound editing was done by Cameron Wong
(developer of the Ekho speech synthesizer) and
Silas Brown, using Audacity and Praat.

If you are running on Linux on a solid-state device (OLPC XO, NSLU2, etc),
you probably don't want Gradint to have to concatenate these files to make a
custom WAV for each phrase.  Linux is usually good enough for Gradint not to
have to do this, in which case you can convert them back to WAV by doing:

for N in zh/yali/*.raw ; do sox -t raw -r 44100 -s -2 $N $(echo $N|sed -e s/raw$/wav/) && rm $N; done && rm header.wav
