(developer of the Ekho speech synthesizer) and
Silas Brown, using Audacity and Praat.

yali-voice.exe is a zip file that must be
compatible with unzip on non-Windows platforms
as well as being self-extracting.

unzipsfx.exe is a Win32 build of unzipsfx
(cross-compiled with Mingw32) with
CHEAP_SFX_AUTORUN defined, and hacked process.c
so it doesn't confirm the Auto-run command.

Use 'make' to make a new yali-voice.exe from the WAVs.

Gradint is at http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/gradint
and is also mirrored at http://ssb22.gitlab.io/gradint as the Cambridge "DS-Web" server sometimes gets taken down for several days of maintenance.
